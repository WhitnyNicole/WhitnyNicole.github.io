So I finished my first project! It certainly wasn't easy, but I did it. While it's not perfect, my code does run, so that's something to be proud of, right? The past two weeks have been full of endless coding. Long nights spent in front of the computer: reading materials, doing labs, watching video lectures, you name it. Looking back, here is what I learned:

1. Take notes. Good meaningful notes. Ensure you include plenty of examples. Go back to your notes often
2. Ask questions. It's okay not to know everything. Don't be afraid to ask for help
3. Start early. Ensure you are giving yourself plenty of time. Write out a schedule, create a to-do list. Stay on track
4. Enjoy the process. It's going to be hard, you might feel like you can't do it, but keep going!
5. Learn from your mistakes
6. Take more notes!

It's a pretty big deal to code your first project. Even if it's not perfect, be proud of yourself and the work you have accomplished. It's only going to get better from here.
