I have officially completed one year at the Flatiron School! I started my bootcamp prep work in October 2018. As a student in the online part-time software engineering program, I had to complete 10 months of structured learning. Below is an account of things I wish I knew before starting and a reflection of my time as a student.

1. **Come in with a plan:** It's okay not to know exactly what kind of job you want coming in. Even if you have some idea, it might change as you get further into the curriculum. However, having an initial plan will help you set a goal and stay committed and focused throughout the duration of the program.
2. **Be prepared and committed to the workload**: The workload is really 20-25 hours per week throughout the duration of the program. Be prepared to set aside consistent time each week to complete your readings, labs and projects. Some weeks will be lighter than others and there are several break weeks throughout the program; however, it's best to plan ahead for 20-25 hours per week.
3. **Let people know what you're doing!:** Talk to friends, peers, managers, etc. and let them know what you're doing. You'll be surprised how many people are willing to support you during your journey!
4. **Network**: Coming into the program, I did not know, personally, a single software engineer. This made it hard initially as I didn't really know what to expect entering the industry. However, I was able to network and find a support system
5. **Intern**: if you're able to do so, try to intern before completing the program. I find this very valuable as I was able to work on a production application while still having the necessary resources to continue learning. 
6. **Show Confidence:** Many times you will face a lab or you'll look at the project requirements and feel like you have no idea where to begin. That's okay. Break things into smaller steps, ask questions, remain calm. You'll get through it!
7. **Celebrate Your Success**: You're undertaking something extremely challenging, but completely worthwhile, celebrate each accomplishment along the way and keep track of your progress.


Good luck to all the incoming students!
